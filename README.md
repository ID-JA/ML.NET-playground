simple demo on how to invoke AI modal using HTTP request.

### Note
This project marks my initial foray into machine learning, with absolutely zero prior experience in the field. Expect to find remnants of my learning curve and possibly some unconventional approaches. It may contain instances of less-than-optimal practices as I navigated the learning process.
this is just the beginning. I'm committed to continuous learning, and future iterations of this project will undoubtedly showcase improved techniques and a deeper understanding of machine learning concepts
